# winetracker
This is an app built on the MEAN stack which allows users to enter in and upload wine information for their personal cellar.

This app makes use of services in way similar to a data store with one-way data binding using rxjs observables that are shared between components.  Some instances of two-way data binding are used but only locally within a single component when creating new instances of a given data type. 

For now, this is just a project I am using to explore the MEAN stack and expand my skillset.  This may change one day but for now its open source.  

This project is very much still in development so there is no semantic versioning yet. 

I will be creating separate branches for each of the major features and big fixes that get added to the product and they will be merged into the dev-branch.  When this is stable I will merge that up to master.  

the product_backlog.md will contain a list of major features that will be added and I will use the issues tab in github for bugs that are really bugs and not just incomplete features.
